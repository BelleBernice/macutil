# HEAVY DEVELOPMENT

- Make a theme that looks good
- fix references to common script or compile common script functions into the sh files under `scripts/`
- Look at creating or installing a package into /Applications or other methods like copying to ~/.local/bin
- Realtime verbose output of script execution - Right now, it only shows output AFTER the script has finished executing.

# Installation
